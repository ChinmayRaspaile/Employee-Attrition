# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project aims to predict employee attrition using various machine learning techniques. Employee attrition is a critical issue for many organizations, and the ability to predict which employees are likely to leave can help in designing effective retention strategies.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Loading**: Loads the dataset and checks for missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes visualizations to explore attrition trends and relationships with other variables.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Encodes categorical variables and scales features.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Implements machine learning models and evaluates performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`

Install the libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
